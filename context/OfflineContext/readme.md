The code in this folder was never tested!

This folder has 3 files to maintain an OfflineContext.

  - OfflineContext.tsx which holds all information about the reducer, provider, context and localstorage logic
  - types.d.ts which holds all types information
  - syncer which holds all information about how the data is synced and a default wrapper for inserts
  - 

The Provider is wrapped around all necessary components that should have offline behaviour.
