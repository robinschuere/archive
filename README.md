I am Robin Schuerewegen, a Software Developer living in Belgium. 

Started in 2011 with writing software in .Net with Silverlight and Sql-Server. After 5 years I made the switch to Fullstack javascript developer.

I think that a lot of what I do and see in the current workspace, is not new, and thus I wanted to place the information that I still have inside a repository to look back on.

Information that you will find here (as of this moment) is heavily linked to:

- ReactJs
- NodeJs
- Agile Scrum
- Architecture

Disclaimer:

```ts
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (codeBlock.isTested) {
    resolve('Yes it is');
  } else {
    reject("No, it wasn't. You might want to double-check what you are copying...");
  }
})
```
