I am Robin Schuerewegen, a Developer living in Belgium.

I think that a lot of what I do and see in the current workspace, is not new, and thus I wanted to place the information that I still have inside a repository to look back on.

Information that you will find here (as of this moment) is heavily linked to:

- ReactJs
- Agile Scrum
- Architecture

Disclaimer:

code that is visible here, is not truly tested. I will try to make sure that this happens, but it is not a promise!
