# Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto is a document that outlines the core values and principles of Agile software development. It was written in 2001 by 17 independent-minded software practitioners, including Kent Beck, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, and Robert C. Martin, among others.

## The Four Values
The Agile Manifesto emphasizes four core values:

- Individuals and Interactions: Value individuals and their interactions over processes and tools.
- Working Software: Value working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer Collaboration: Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to Change: Value responding to change over following a plan.

## The 12 Principles
The Agile Manifesto also outlines 12 principles that support these values:

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more agile and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
