# Story estimations

Estimation (or estimating): 
  is the process of finding an estimate or approximation, which is a value that is usable for some purpose even if input data may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable. The value is nonetheless usable because it is derived from the best information available. Typically, estimation involves "using the value of a statistic derived from a sample to estimate the value of a corresponding population parameter". The sample provides information that can be projected, through various formal or informal processes, to determine a range most likely to describe the missing information. An estimate that turns out to be incorrect will be an overestimate if the estimate exceeds the actual result and an underestimate if the estimate falls short of the actual result.

## Estimations and Agile Scrum

The agile community has different ways as to how to estimate this points.

- X amount of hours
- X amount of days
- complexity
- T-shirt sizes
- ...

Information about how Scrum thinks about this can be found [here](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/what-scrum-says-about-estimates).

## Where does it go wrong?

The question for why estimations are there can be found in the nature of work itself. 

```
How long does it take to do X? 

- It will take Y days.
```

Often we forget the next sentence being

```
How much will it cost?

- It will then cost Z$/day
```

It is exactly because of this setup that estimations are requested by either party to create something. (Not software specific)

But, why does it go wrong on the software level?

Because software teams are not always doing estimations for the right reasons. Often, a manager role wants to see how long something does to work out, the team reluctantly starts doing estimations. Everybody happy?

I think that many of the things that go wrong is how the estimations are brought up, and afterwards, how we work on them.

## Playing Rules

- Does everybody believe in story points?
- Does everybody in the team knows what they are doing in the code?
- Does everybody believe that the story remains unchanged during a sprint?
- Do we have a common technique on how to attain a story point?
  - Complexity
  - T-shirt sizes
  - Dirty Hours
  - Man days
  - ...

It is only after asking these questions that we can start doing story points.

## How to continue

Give yourself 3-6 months to work with the estimations. Nobody is getting it right from the first time.
Depending on the product and the shifting complexity, you have to redo this cycle many times to come up with a good base for doing estimations.
