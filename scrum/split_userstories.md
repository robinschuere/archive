# Splitting User Stories on Whiteboard

Splitting user stories is a crucial step in Agile product development, allowing teams to break down large, complex stories into smaller, manageable pieces. A whiteboard can be a valuable tool in this process, enabling teams to visualize and collaborate on story splitting. Here are some techniques and best practices for splitting user stories with a whiteboard:

Start with the original user story: Write the original user story on the whiteboard, using a format like “As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].”
Identify key steps or paths: Break down the original story into its constituent parts or paths. Use arrows or lines to connect these steps, illustrating the flow of the story.
Focus on functional boundaries: Split the story along functional boundaries, such as:

- User roles (e.g., buyer, admin, seller)
- Data types (e.g., currencies, units of measure)
- Interfaces (e.g., web, mobile, API)
- Use sticky notes or markers: Write each split story on a sticky note or use markers to highlight the new story boundaries on the whiteboard.
- Collaborate and refine: Have team members review and refine the split stories, ensuring they are still aligned with the original user story’s intent and goals.
- Estimate and prioritize: Estimate the effort required for each split story and prioritize them based on business value and complexity.

By using a whiteboard to split user stories, teams can:

- Visualize the breakdown of complex stories
- Collaborate and refine the split stories
- Ensure alignment with the original user story’s intent and goals
- Estimate and prioritize the split stories effectively

Remember to keep the whiteboard clean and organized, and to involve the entire team in the story-splitting process to ensure everyone is on the same page.
